## Solving Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation has the form
$$
Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0
$$

To solve the quadratic equation analytically, we ﬁrst divide by A:
$$
x^2 + \frac{B}{A}x + \frac{C}{A} = 0
$$
Then we “complete the square” to group terms:
$$
{(x + \frac{B}{2A})}^2 - \frac{B^2}{4A^2} + \frac{C}{A} = 0
$$
Moving the constant portion to the right-hand side and taking the square root gives
$$
x + \frac{B}{2A} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4A^2} - \frac{C}{A}}
$$
Subtracting B/(2A) from both sides and grouping terms with the denominator
2A gives the familiar form: 
$$
x = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \\
D \equiv B^2 - 4AC
$$
which is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation. If D > 0, there are two real solutions (also called roots). If D = 0, there is one real solution (a “double” root). If D < 0, there are no real solutions.
